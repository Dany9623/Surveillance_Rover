INTRODUCTION

The development of IoT applications with robotics is an ongoing revaluation. Rover mainly focuses on security, remote surveillance, monitoring, and detecting Movement in collapsed places.
Rover has become the most important research topic over the past decade. Through the Project, we put forward a surveillance robot that can be used in dangerous areas and many other places.
Rovers becoming important in day-to-day activities as they reduce human lives and support.
We can control Rover automatically or can be manually based on the situation. Rover focuses on the design and implementation of Army support for detection and avoidance in hazardous areas.

OBJECTIVE

● Development of light security mechanisms.

● Security and privacy must be maintained from the information source (sensors in or on the body, nanoscale communications system, etc.) to the final destination.

● Wireless communication system.

● These systems mainly consist of high-quality cameras, multiple computers for monitoring, and servers for storing.

● Advanced knowledge in the area of intelligent wireless networks.

METHODOLOGY

The first quadcopter & camera got power and turned on. Then quadcopter starts mapping the area for 30 min. If any human live or smoke is detected while mapping it gives the location of that place immediately to the operator by sending an image. While quadcopter mapping the place rover also works simultaneously. To control sensors Arduino microcontroller is used. To control the four wheels of the rover BTS7960 motor driver we have used and to control servo motors of mechanical claw & camera we have used servo motor driver module. Rover can’t be accessed until the RFID is not matched. If RFID matched then the rover follows the path provided by the operator. While surveying the area if any sensor got logic 1 then the microcontroller activated all the sensors. If any human or smoke is detected by these sensors, then immediately alert the authorities. Among all these, if the battery is less than 10% then the operator gets a red light blinking and has to take the back rover to the base station immediately.
