The development of IoT applications with robotics is an ongoing revaluation. Rover mainly focuses on security, remote surveillance, monitoring, and detecting Movement in collapsed places.
Rover has become the most important research topic over the past decade. Through the Project, we put forward a surveillance robot that can be used in dangerous areas and many other places.
Rovers becoming important in day-to-day activities as they reduce human lives and support.
We can control Rover automatically or can be manually based on the situation. Rover focuses on the design and implementation of Army support for detection and avoidance in hazardous areas.
